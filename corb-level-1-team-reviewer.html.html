MGT CANNOT MAKE YOU SIGN ANYTHING YOU FEEL IS NOT RIGHT.", "question": "​You are the KO in a Source Selection and your higher leadership is now giving you direction which you believe is contrary to your legal guidance. How do you handle and what would you do?"}, {"topic": "Inspection and Acceptance", "answer": "In accordance with the FAR, inspection and acceptance are crucial for the Government to ensure it receives supplies and services that fully conform to contract requirements, thereby safeguarding taxpayer money and protecting Government interests. Inspection verifies quality and quantity, allowing for identification and correction of deficiencies before formal acceptance. Acceptance signifies the Government's approval, leading to payment obligations for the Government and typically transferring title and risk of loss from the contractor, while also limiting the Government's ability to revoke acceptance later.", "question": "Why is inspection and acceptance important to the Government?"}, {"topic": "Source Selection", "answer": "Should indicate that experience reflects WHAT an offeror has done (similar to a resume) and past performance reflects HOW WELL the offeror performed the work (similar to a performance appraisal).", "question": "Explain the difference between an offeror’s experience and an offeror’s past performance."}, {"topic": "Binding Contract", "answer": "Must involve two or more parties that have the capacity to contract.  Must show agreement, including offer, acceptance, and mutual assent.  Must show something of value changing hands between the parties to a contract, or other inducement that leads a person to make a promise.  Must be for a legal purpose.  Must be in the correct form.", "question": "A legally binding contract must contain what elements?"}, {"topic": "Fiscal Law", "answer": "            The Bona Fide Need rule (law) requires appropriated funds be used only for goods and services for which a need arises during the period of that appropriation’s availability for obligation. The bona fide needs rule is a rule of appropriations law.  It mandates that a fiscal year's appropriations be obligated only to meet a legitimate-or bona fide-need arising in (for sometimes before) the fiscal year for which the appropriation was made.  It restricts this year's appropriated funds from being used to fund next fiscal year's requirements.  For example, annual funds (such as operations and maintenance funding) appropriated for fiscal year (FY) 2014 are to be used to fund legitimate or genuine FY2014 needs and are not to be used to fund a need the agency won't actually have until FY2015.  ", "question": "Explain the “Bona Fide Needs” rule."}, {"topic": "Order of Precedence", "answer": "Schedule (excluding specifications); representations and certifications; contract clauses; other document, exhibits, and attachments; the specifications.", "question": "What is the order of precedence for a solicitation or contract in accordance with FAR 52.215-8?  For example, the specifications require a different item than is stated in the Schedule (Section B).  What does the contractor use?"}, {"topic": "Closeout", "answer": "Extremely important because excess funds may need to be deobligated; in addition, many types of contracts require the withholding of final payments, which can amount to large sums of money for the Contractor (cash flow issue).", "question": "Once all receivables have been delivered/completed and verified by the customer/COR, the ACO or KO reviews the contract files for remaining closeout actions. Why is contract closeout so important?  What actions need to be taken in closeout?"}, {"topic": "Source Selection", "answer": "The Government evaluated proposals and determined which were the most highly rated and eligible for inclusion in the competitive range relying on the merits of each offer. The merits of each offer were determined on the basis of:  (1) The quality of the technical proposal based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria. (2) The proposed cost/prices. Those proposals not included in the competitive range will receive no further consideration and will be notified of this in accordance with FAR Part 15.503.", "question": "On a full and open competitive negotiated acquisition, you have received five proposals and determined that discussions are needed, what is the process of determining which offerors are in the competitive range for these discussions?"}, {"topic": "Source Selection", "answer": "When facing a competitive requirement, the determination of whether to use a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) or Tradeoff best value approach, as per FAR Part 15.101, hinges on the nature of the requirement and the degree of value the Government places on factors other than price. An LPTA approach is appropriate when the requirement is clearly defined, the risk of unsuccessful performance is minimal, and there is no significant benefit or willingness to pay for exceeding minimum technical or performance standards; for example, procuring commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items like office supplies or standard IT hardware where capabilities are standardized and objective. Conversely, a Tradeoff process is suitable when it may be in the Government's best interest to consider awarding to other than the lowest-priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror, allowing for evaluation of perceived benefits of a higher-priced proposal based on non-cost factors like technical approach, past performance, or innovation; an example would be a complex research and development project where an innovative technical solution, even at a higher price, could yield significant long-term benefits or reduce performance risk. The solicitation must clearly state the chosen approach and the relative importance of all evaluation factors.", "question": "If you have a competitive requirement, how will you determine the Best Value Approach to use in regards to choosing LPTA or Tradeoff?  Also, give at least one example when each is appropriate."}, {"topic": "Leadership and Training", "answer": "To mentor a new Contract Specialist, I'd focus on building foundational FAR knowledge and practical application, emphasizing FAR Part 1 principles of sound business judgment. For their development, I'd provide a structured onboarding plan including: in-depth FAR navigation (FAR 1.102 guiding principles, FAR 4, 12, 13, 15, 46 being initial focuses), agency-specific policies, hands-on experience with simplified acquisitions, and guided exposure to market research and source selection documentation. Key tools for them would be: direct access to FARSite or similar online FAR/agency supplement resources, SAM.gov for market research and vendor registration, CPARS for past performance data, and our agency's contract writing system.", "question": "How would you mentor a new Contract Specialist (recent intern graduate) that has been assigned to your team?  What tools would you provide to your specialist in accomplishing their duties?  What tools do you use in accomplishing your duties?"}, {"topic": "Unauthorized Commitment", "answer": "An unauthorized commitment is means an agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the Government.  The act of approving an unauthorized commitment is called a ratification. Unauthorized commitments may be ratified only when the conditions of FAR 1.602-3(c) are met.  a) Use of appropriated funds, b) Provided to or accepted by the Government - received a benefit, c) Ratification official has the authority to ratify, d) Resulting contract must otherwise be proper, e) Price must be fair & reasonable, f) Funds are available and were available at the time the action occurred, g) The CO recommends payments, h) It is IAW other requirements and limitations", "question": "What is an unauthorized commitment?  What steps do you take in evaluating, processing and approving an unauthorized commitment?"}, {"topic": "Contract Administration", "answer": "​A Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is an individual designated by the Contracting Officer to act as their representative in the technical monitoring and surveillance of a contract.  These individuals serve as subject matter experts and perform surveillance of a contract to insure that the goods and services obtained meet the government's acceptance standards.  A COR may be designated other administration duties by the contracting officer. A COR should be nominated by the requirements official as early as practicable in the acquisition process.  A COR assist in the technical monitoring or administration of a contract.  (A)  Contracting officers shall designate a COR for all service contracts, including both firm-fixed-price and other than firm-fixed-price contracts, awarded by a DoD component or by any other Federal agency on behalf of DoD.  The surveillance activities performed by CORs should be tailored to the dollar value/complexity of the specific contract for which they are designated.  The COR does not have the authority to take any action, either directly or indirectly, that could change the price/cost or fee, quantity, quality, scope, delivery schedule, labor mix or other terms and conditions of the contract and/or task order.  Only the contracting officer has the authority to make such changes. CORs do not have contractual authority to issue directions or changes to any contract or purchase order that affects price, quality, quantity, delivery, or any other aspect that will change the terms and conditions of the contract.  In cases where changes have been made by unauthorized personnel, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) must be immediately notified.  The PCO will then determine if the work performed was within the scope of the original contract. If the work is determined to be outside the scope of the contract, corrective action through the ratification process will be taken.  CORs shall forward any correspondence received from the contractor to the PCO. COR restrictions and limitations include, but are not limited to the following:  1)  COR authority may not be re-delegated. 2) Only DoD military or DoD civilian personnel may be appointed as CORs. Non-DoD personnel, including foreign nationals, shall not be appointed as CORs. 3) The COR shall not make any agreement with the contractor requiring the obligation of public funds. 4) The COR shall not sign any contract, including delivery orders, purchase orders, nor modify a contract, or in a n way obligate funds for the Government. 5) The COR shall not encourage the contractor by words, actions, or a failure to act to undertake new work or an extension of existing work beyond the contract period. 6) The COR shall not interfere with the contractor's management prerogative by \"supervising\" contractor employees or otherwise directing their work efforts. 7) The COR shall not authorize a contractor to obtain property for use under a contract. 8) The COR shall not allow government-furnished property accountable under one contract to be used in the performance of work under another contract. 9) The COR shall not issue instructions to the contractor to start or stop work. 10) The COR shall not order or accept goods or services not expressly required by the contract. 11) The COR shall not discuss acquisition plans or provide any advance information that might give one contractor an advantage over another contractor in future procurements.", "question": "What do you envision is the role of your CORs?  When are you required to appoint one?  What authorities are you allowed to delegate to your COR?  What authorities are not delegable to the COR?"}, {"topic": "Contract Administration", "answer": "​First you should notify your attorney that you have received an Request for Equitable Adjustment (REA). Then, you will need to determine whether the contractor's request has any merit. If you determine that the request has merit, you may attempt to negotiate a settlement with the contractor, involving your attorney as you deem necessary. If negotiating with the contractor is difficult, and the involvement of your program counsel has not helped, you may refer the case to legal for formal Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Formal ADR can be accomplished either before or after the issuance of a final decision. If you determine that the REA is without merit, you may still attempt to discuss the issues with the contractor prior to issuing the PCO's final decision. Once a stalemate has occurred and the claim can't be resolved at the PCO level, a final decision is issued and an appeal is processed.", "question": "Your contractor presents you with a request for equitable adjustment (claim).

Discuss any differences in the process based on different threshold levels."}, {"topic": "Competition", "answer": "​Review the requirements for urgent procurements, FAR 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency. Ensure the J&A includes: (1) The date the requirement was first known and the circumstances leading to urgency.  \n(2) The quantity of items or services appropriate for the urgent procurement with supporting rationale. An urgent procurement should rarely, if ever, contain an option quantity. (3) The required product or service delivery schedule. (4) The reason(s) for delay in initiating the acquisition if the date the requirement identified was such that normal contracting and production lead times could have achieved delivery by the required date. \n(5) The harm (financial or other) to the government that would result if the required delivery dates are not met. Include estimated expenses the government would likely incur due to the delay, and explain the basis for this estimate. (6) If the requiring office is specifying the source(s) appropriate for this procurement, explain the expertise required and discuss the contractors' capability to meet the urgent requirement.\nSynopsis not required if Unusual and Compelling Urgency. J&A's citing urgency shall be publically available 30 days after contract award. ", "question": "Your customer has submitted an urgent requirement and believes that we should limit the number of sources or go to only one source.  Describe your process/steps that you will take in validating the urgency and either processing and approving a sole source/limited source J&A or denying it.  Address any leniencies associated with urgency (synopsis, posting, etc.) if any."}, {"topic": "Contract Type", "answer": "​A wide selection of contract types is available to the Government and contractors to provide needed flexibility in acquiring the large variety and volume of supplies and services required by agencies.  Contract types vary according to: (1)  The degree and timing of the responsibility assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance, and (2) The amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. (b) The contract types are grouped into two broad categories, fixed-price contracts, cost-reimbursement contracts.  The specific contract types range from firm-fixed-price, in which the contractor has full responsibility for the performance costs and resulting profit (or loss), to cost-plus-fixed-fee, in which the contractor has minimal responsibility for the performance costs and the negotiated fee (profit) is fixed.  In between are the various incentive contracts in which the contractor's responsibility for the performance costs and the profit or fee incentives offered are tailored to the uncertainties involved in contract performance. There are many factors that the contracting officer should consider in selecting and negotiating the contract type.  They include the following:  (a)  Price competition.  Normally, effective price competition results in realistic pricing, and fixed-price contract is ordinarily in the Government's interest. (b) Price analysis.  Price analysis, with or without competition, may provide a basis for selecting the contract type.  The degrees to which price analysis can provide a realistic pricing standard should be carefully considered.  See FAR 15.404-1(b) (c) Cost analysis.  In the absence of effective price competition and if price analysis is not sufficient, the cost estimates of the offeror and the Government provide the basis for negotiating contract pricing arrangements.  It is essential that the uncertainties involved in performance and their possible impact upon costs be identified and evaluated, so that a contract type that places a reasonable degree of cost responsibility upon the contractor can be negotiated.  (d) type and complexity of the requirement.  Complex requirements, particularly those unique to the Government, usually result in greater risk assumption by the Government.  This is especially true for complex research and development contracts, when performance uncertainties or the likelihood of changes makes it difficult to estimate performance costs in advance.  As a requirement recurs or as quantity production begins, the cost risk should shift to the contractor, and a fixed-price contract should be considered. (e) Combining contract types.  If the entire contract cannot be firm-fixed-price, the contracting officer shall consider whether or not a portion of the contract can be established on a firm-fixed-price basis. (f) Urgency of the requirement.  If urgency is a primary factor, the Government may choose to assume a greater proportion of risk or it may offer incentives tailored to performance outcomes to ensure timely contract performance.  (g)  Period of performance or length of production risk in times of economic uncertainty, contracts extending over a relatively long period may require economic price adjustment or price redetermination clauses (h)  Contractor's technical capability and financial responsibility (i) Adequacy of the contractor's accounting system.  Before agreeing on a contract type other than firm-fixed-price, the contracting officer shall ensure that the contractor's accounting system will permit timely development of all necessary cost data in the form required by the proposed contract type. ", "question": "How do you determine the most appropriate contract type?  Give examples of when you would use the different types."}, {"topic": "Responsibility", "answer": "Per FAR Part 9.1, a prospective contractor is deemed \"responsible\" if they possess the necessary financial resources, ability to meet delivery schedules, a satisfactory performance and ethics record, and the organizational, experience, and technical capabilities. An affirmative determination of responsibility is mandatory before award. For contracts at or below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), the FAR generally allows less extensive inquiry and documentation into responsibility, often relying on readily available information and foregoing preaward surveys unless justified by cost (FAR 9.105-2(a)(1), 9.106-1(a)). Conversely, for contracts exceeding the SAT, more rigorous investigation, including preaward surveys, may be necessary to ensure all responsibility standards are met due to the higher value and complexity.

Other government organizations, such as program offices, inventory control points, and sustainment commands, may be parties to such agreements. 4 There is a key distinction between partnerships and defense contracts. All partnerships are implemented within the framework and business arrangements established by a contract between the DoD and a private-sector entity (e.g., an original equipment manufacturer [OEM], small business, or other third-party logistics provider [3PL]). Defense contracts specify the work tasks, articles, services, and outcomes to be provided by the private-sector entity. They are generally one-sided in their directive requirements—from the government to the contractor. Partnerships enable a more collaborative relationship in which parties from both public and private-sectors are able to leverage and maximize the use of their resources in ways that were not specified in their underlying contracts. Resources may include goods, services, infrastructure, products, personnel, or processes employed to more efficiently and effectively accomplish product support. Examples range from allowing contractors to utilize depot maintenance facilities, to workshare agreements in which joint organic-contractor teams join forces on a common workload, to contractor purchase of government-provided products and services. The parties may be separately funded by defense contracts or work orders.

A direct sale agreement begins with a government contract that funds a commercial activity. In turn, after development of a partnership agreement with an appropriate implementing agreement, the contractor pays an organic depot maintenance activity (or other industrially funded activity as authorized) for goods and services provided to the contractor. Depending on the legal authority applied, the funds may be paid to the U.S. Treasury or directly to the depot’s working capital fund. The contractor may also supply materiel to the depots in support of the partnership. The purchase of articles or services by the commercial entity establishes a quasi-subcontract relationship for the depot, which ensures (as authorized by law) the depot can be held accountable for willful misconduct, gross negligence, or the failure of the government to comply with cost, schedule, or performance requirements in the contract agreement.", "question": "Who funds the depot/arsenal in a Direct Sale and when?"}, {"topic": "Public Private Partnership - Direct Sales", "answer": "A team of directorate and staff office representatives/subject matter experts brought together for the purpose of evaluating ANAD’s capacity, capability, risk, and business case.", "question": "What is the Direct Sales Integrated Process Team (IPT)?"}, {"topic": "Public Private Partnership - Direct Sales", "answer": "This team develops the initial scope, schedule, and Rough Order Magnitude (ROM), against a prospective Partner’s proposed P3 project.
